## Heroku Node.js npm Install



! Missing lockfile
!
! Couldn't determine Node.js package manager. Package manager lockfile not found.
!
! A lockfile from a supported package manager is required to install Node.js dependencies. The package.json for this project specifies dependencies, but there isn't a lockfile.
!
! - To use npm to install dependencies, run `npm install`. This command will generate a `package-lock.json` lockfile.
! - To use yarn to install dependencies, run `yarn install`. This command will generate a `yarn.lock` lockfile.
! - To use pnpm to install dependencies, run `pnpm install`. This command will generate a `pnpm-lock.yaml` lockfile.
!
! Ensure the resulting lockfile is committed to the repository, then try again.
