! An unexpected error occurred while configuring the store directory for pnpm. This is the directory where pnpm links all installed packages from the store.

! The causes for this error are unknown. We do not have suggestions for diagnosis or a workaround at this time. You can help our understanding by sharing your buildpack log and a description of the issue at:

! If you're able to reproduce the problem with an example application and the `pack` build tool (https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-platform-operators/how-to/integrate-ci/pack/), adding that information to the discussion will also help. Once we have more information around the causes of this error we may update this message.
