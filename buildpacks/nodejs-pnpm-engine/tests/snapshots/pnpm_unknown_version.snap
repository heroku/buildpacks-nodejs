## Heroku Node.js pnpm Engine



! Corepack Requirement Error
!
! A pnpm lockfile (`pnpm-lock.yaml`) was detected, but the version of `pnpm` to install could not be determined.
!
! `pnpm` may be installed via the `heroku/nodejs-corepack` buildpack. It requires the desired `pnpm` version to be set via the `packageManager` key in `package.json`.
!
! To set `packageManager` in `package.json` to the latest `pnpm`, run:
!
! `corepack enable`
! `corepack use pnpm@*`
!
! Then commit the result, and try again.
