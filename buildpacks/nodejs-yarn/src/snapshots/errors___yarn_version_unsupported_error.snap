! Unsupported Yarn version
!
! The Heroku Node.js Yarn buildpack does not support Yarn version 0.
!
! Suggestions:
! - Update your package.json to specify a supported Yarn version.
!
! If the issue persists and you think you found a bug in the buildpack, reproduce the issue locally with a minimal example. Open an issue in the buildpack's GitHub repository and include the details here:
