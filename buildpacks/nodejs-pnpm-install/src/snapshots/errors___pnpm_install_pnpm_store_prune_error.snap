! Failed to prune packages from the store directory
!
! The Heroku Node.js pnpm Install buildpack periodically cleans up the store directory to remove packages that are no longer in use from the cache. An unexpected error occurred during this operation.
!
! The causes for this error are unknown. We do not have suggestions for diagnosis or a workaround at this time. You can help our understanding by sharing your buildpack log and a description of the issue at:
! https://github.com/heroku/buildpacks-nodejs/issues
!
! If you're able to reproduce the problem with an example application and the `pack` build tool (https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-platform-operators/how-to/integrate-ci/pack/), adding that information to the discussion will also help. Once we have more information around the causes of this error we may update this message.
