  - Done (<time_elapsed>)
- Pruning dev dependencies

! Pruning skipped due to presence of lifecycle scripts
!
! The version of pnpm used (8.11.0) will execute the following lifecycle scripts declared in package.json during pruning which can cause build failures:
! - pnpm:devPreinstall
! - preinstall
! - install
! - postinstall
! - prepare
!
! Since pruning can't be done safely for your build, it will be skipped. To fix this you must upgrade your version of pnpm to 8.15.6 or higher.
