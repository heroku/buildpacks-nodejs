! Couldn't parse Node.js inventory
!
! The Heroku Node.js Engine buildpack embeds the content of the `./inventory.toml` found in this buildpack's repository into its binary to look up and resolve Node.js versions but the content isn't valid TOML.
!
! The causes for this error are unknown. We do not have suggestions for diagnosis or a workaround at this time. You can help our understanding by sharing your buildpack log and a description of the issue at:
! https://github.com/heroku/buildpacks-nodejs/issues

! If you're able to reproduce the problem with an example application and the `pack` build tool (https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-platform-operators/how-to/integrate-ci/pack/), adding that information to the discussion will also help. Once we have more information around the causes of this error we may update this message.
