! Error parsing project.toml with invalid configuration type
!
! This buildpack reads the configuration from `project.toml` to complete the build but the configuration value for `prune_dev_dependencies` in the section `[com.heroku.buildpacks.nodejs.actions]` isn't the correct type. The value of this key must be a boolean.
!
! Suggestions:
! - See the TOML documentation for more details on the TOML boolean type at https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0
!
! Use the debug information above to troubleshoot and retry your build.
